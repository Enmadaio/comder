Create a commander program whose only function is to output it's version (`0.0.1`) to console.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make a Node.js program, create a new file with a `.js` extension and start writing JavaScript! Execute your program by running it with the
`node` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ node program.js
```

You have installed commander, right?  If not then install it to `\node_modules` in the current directory:
```sh
npm install commander
```

Create a program by requiring 'commander', then set the version on that program with `.version('...')` and read the version with `.version()`


When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
